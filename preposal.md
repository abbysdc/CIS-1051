# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My idea is to make a Minecraft themed word game. Possibly something like the game Wordle but with Minecraft related words. The game will start and ask which gamemode you want to play in. Creative mode will give you unlimited chances to guess the word and will give you the option to continue playing or leave the game. Survival mode will give the user 5 chances to guess the word. If they fail, an ASCII creeper will show up on the screen, "explode" the user (maybe I'll add sound) just like in Minecraft. A "You died!" message will appear and the player will have the option to "Respawn" or exit the game. The survival mode option will also ask the user for the game difficulty they wish to play in. Normal will just be normal, hard mode will be six letter words. The user will also have the option to play in Hardcore. Hardcore will play out the same way but the user will only have a single guess (in Minecraft Hardcore you have one life and if you die you can't play on the world).

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No. The idea may be a bit too ambitious but it's very amusing to me.

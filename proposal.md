# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mincraft Wordle

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A minecraft themed Wordle with a twist.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project is something like the game Wordle but with Minecraft related words. The game will start and ask which gamemode you want to play in. Creative mode will give you unlimited chances to guess the word and will give you the option to continue playing or leave the game. Survival mode will give the user 5 chances to guess the word. If they fail, an ASCII creeper will show up on the screen, "explode" the user (maybe I'll add sound) just like in Minecraft. A "You died!" message will appear and the player will have the option to "Respawn" or exit the game. The survival mode option will also ask the user for the game difficulty they wish to play in. Normal will just be normal, hard mode will be six letter words. The user will also have the option to play in Hardcore. Hardcore will play out the same way but the user will only have one chance to guess the word (in Minecraft Hardcore you have one life and if you die you can't play on the world).


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will be able to create a game similar to Wordle. It may not have a great look, and it may not be able to deny entries that aren't actually words. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Realistically, I think I can add in all the features that I detailed above that would make my project Minecraft themed like prompting the user for game modes and changing the game accordingly. It make not look the way I want it to though.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my project would be if it worked as I detailed in the paragraph above and it had a good look to it as well.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to look into ways to change the text color. Yellow for the letters that are in the word but it the wrong spot, and green for the letters in the right spot. I will also have to find a way to make sure that each word the user inputs exists. Also possibly incorporating a sound file into it is something I might want to incorporate, but I need to look up how to do.
